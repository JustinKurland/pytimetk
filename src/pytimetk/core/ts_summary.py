    '''
    Computes summary statistics for a time series data, either for the entire 
    dataset or grouped by a specific column.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame or pd.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy
        The `data` parameter can be either a Pandas DataFrame or a Pandas 
        DataFrameGroupBy object. It represents the data that you want to 
        summarize.
    date_column : str
        The `date_column` parameter is a string that specifies the name of the 
        column in the DataFrame that contains the dates. This column will be 
        used to compute summary statistics for the time series data.
    
    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        The `ts_summary` function returns a summary of time series data. The 
        summary includes the following statistics:
        - If grouped data is provided, the returned data will contain the 
          grouping columns first.
        - `date_n`: The number of observations in the time series.
        - `date_tz`: The time zone of the time series.
        - `date_start`: The first date in the time series.
        - `date_end`: The last date in the time series.
        - `freq_inferred_unit`: The inferred frequency of the time series from 
                               `pandas`.
        - `freq_median_timedelta`: The median time difference between 
                                   consecutive observations in the time series.
        - `freq_median_scale`: The median time difference between consecutive 
                               observations in the time series, scaled to a 
                              common unit.
        - `freq_median_unit`: The unit of the median time difference between 
                              consecutive observations in the time series.
        - `diff_min`: The minimum time difference between consecutive 
                      observations in the time series as a timedelta.
        - `diff_q25`: The 25th percentile of the time difference between 
                      consecutive observations in the time series as a timedelta.
        - `diff_median`: The median time difference between consecutive 
                         observations in the time series as a timedelta.
        - `diff_mean`: The mean time difference between consecutive observations 
                       in the time series as a timedelta.

                      consecutive observations in the time series as a timedelta.
        - `diff_max`: The maximum time difference between consecutive 
                      observations in the time series as a timedelta.
        - `diff_min_seconds`: The minimum time difference between consecutive 
                              observations in the time series in seconds.
        - `diff_q25_seconds`: The 25th percentile of the time difference between 
                              consecutive observations in the time series in 
                              seconds.
        - `diff_median_seconds`: The median time difference between consecutive

    Notes
    -----
    ## Performance
    
    This function uses parallel processing to speed up computation for large 
    datasets with many time series groups: 
    
    Parallel processing has overhead and may not be faster on small datasets.
    
    To use parallel processing, set `threads = -1` to use all available processors.
